A peak can be seen where we expect the $\eta$ with a mass of $m_{\eta} = 547.862 \pm 0.017$ MeV \cite{PDG2018}; fitting the peak with a Gaussian gives a mass of $m_{\eta} = 550.3 \pm 1.8$ MeV and a width of $\Gamma_{\eta} = 12.4 \pm 2.7$ MeV with an estimated significance of 9.6$\sigma$}

show $\rho$ peak which is by-product in charged pi-pi spectrum from 3pi $a_1$ channel. Try to properly fit with fitting script. might be difficult because of weird background, has already been measured in ALICE, e.g. \cite{ALICErho}. \\
