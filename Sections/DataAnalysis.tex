\subsection{Decay channels and analysis strategy}
Use PCM with dielectrons because they have been used before ($\eta'$) and works well with TPC. (mention important decay channels).

show $\rho$ peak which is by-product in charged pi-pi spectrum from 3pi $a_1$ channel. Try to properly fit with fitting script. might be difficult because of weird background, has already been measured in ALICE, e.g. \cite{ALICErho}.

\subsection{Cuts and Event Selection}
quote and discuss cuts
